# 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a Manual of Operating
Procedures (MOP) template for principal investigators (PIs) of multisite
clinical trials. The role of the MOP is to facilitate consistency in
protocol implementation and data collection across participants and
study sites. Use of the MOP increases the likelihood that the results of
the study will be scientifically credible and provides reassurance that
participant safety and scientific integrity are closely monitored.
Investigators of single-site studies are encouraged to consider the
template's contents. However, a MOP is not mandatory for these studies.

In preparing the MOP, the PI (study chair) must be aware of the terms of
award with respect to required reporting, data and safety monitoring,
and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (see Grantee Policies and
Resources). <http://nccih.nih.gov/grants/policies>
