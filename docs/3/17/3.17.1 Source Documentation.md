### 3.17.1 Source Documentation

A source document is any document on which study data are initially
recorded. Source documents include laboratory reports, EKG tracings,
medical records, standardized test forms, etc. These data are then
transcribed to a paper CRF or electronic CRF (eCRF) to document
study-specific data elements.
