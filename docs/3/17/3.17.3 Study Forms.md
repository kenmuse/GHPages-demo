### 3.17.3 Study Forms

Data must be collected consistently across participants and sites so
that any variability is limited to participants' individual responses to
the intervention. Study CRFs provide the vehicle for consistent data
collection. In this section of the MOP, please provide:

-   Study forms and their collection schedule

-   Description of each study form and questionnaire

-   Format for forms production and distribution along with contact
    person

-   Forms maintenance.
