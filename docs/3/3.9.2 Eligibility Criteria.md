### 3.9.2 Eligibility Criteria

Study eligibility is determined by a set of specific inclusion and
exclusion criteria that are outlined in the study protocol. Individuals
must meet all entry criteria prior to treatment assignment. This section
of the MOP defines the criteria, method for determination (e.g., blood
pressure measured in a sitting position after 5 minute rest), and the
specific forms needed to document eligibility (e.g., medical history
form, physical examination form).
