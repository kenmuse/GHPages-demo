## 3.18 Data Flow

It is the site's responsibility to ensure that all forms are complete,
intact, and transmitted to the data manager in a single site study or to
the Coordinating Center, as appropriate. More recently, in some studies,
data are directly entered into an eCRF.

This section of the MOP describes the:

-   Disposition of study forms or data entry into the computer system

-   Schedule for completion and transmission of forms

-   List of forms for which copies are to be maintained at the site and
    forms to be submitted for data entry

-   Data flow, data entry, and data correction procedures.
