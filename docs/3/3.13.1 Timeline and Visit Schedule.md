### 3.13.1 Timeline and Visit Schedule

A useful study tool included in the MOP is a schedule of visits and
evaluations that specifies what is to be done at each study phase and at
each contact with the study participant. An example of a schedule is
provided in [Appendix B](#appendix-b.-sample-schedule-of-events).
