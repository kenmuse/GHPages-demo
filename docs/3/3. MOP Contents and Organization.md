# 3. MOP Contents and Organization

The MOP details the study procedures and describes the study-specific
documents and must be adapted to each study's specific needs. It often
includes the following sections:

a.  Study Protocol or Synopsis

b.  Staff Roster

c.  Study Organization and Responsibilities

d.  Training Plan

e.  Communications Plan

f.  Recruitment and Retention Plan

g.  Study Design Diagram

h.  Screening and Eligibility Criteria and Processes

i.  Informed Consent and HIPAA

j.  Study Intervention

k.  Blinding and Unblinding (Masking or Unmasking)

l.  Evaluations and Followup

m.  Concomitant Medications

n.  Safety Reporting

o.  Data and Safety Monitoring Responsibilities

p.  Study Compliance

q.  Data Collection and Study Forms

r.  Data Management

s.  Quality Control Procedures

t.  Study Completion and Closeout Procedures

u.  Policies

v.  MOP Maintenance

The MOP should include all of the relevant sections from this list that
apply to the specific study. If a section does not apply (e.g.,
randomization for a study with no randomization), it is not included in
the MOP. Additionally, if the study involves a drug intervention, either
the Package Insert for an approved drug or the Investigator's Brochure
for an investigational product must be included as an appendix.
