### 3.25.1 Participant Notification

The PI and study staff or Coordinating Center should develop a letter to
notify participants that the study is completed, ask whether they would
like to be informed of the results, and thank them for their
participation.

In this section of the MOP, please describe a plan for notifying
participants about completion of the study.
