## 3.25 Study Completion and Closeout Procedures

Study closeout activities are performed to confirm that the site
investigator's study obligations have been met and post-study
obligations are understood. This section of the MOP should briefly
outline the study completion and closeout procedures. Details should be
included in the subsequent sections. Examples of closeout activities
include, but are not limited to, the following:

-   Verification that study procedures have been completed, data have
    been collected, and study intervention(s) and supplies are returned
    to the responsible party or prepared for destruction

-   Comparison of the investigator's correspondence and study files
    against the Coordinating Center\'s records for completeness

-   Assurance that all data queries have been completed

-   Assurance that correspondence and study files are accessible for
    external audits

-   Reminder to investigators of their ongoing responsibility to
    maintain study records and to report any relevant study information
    to NCCIH

-   Assurance that the investigator will notify the IRB of the study's
    completion and store a copy of the notification

-   Preparation of a report summarizing the study's conduct

-   Participant notification of the study completion
