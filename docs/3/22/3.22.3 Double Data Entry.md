### 3.22.3 Double Data Entry

In recent years, there have been several articles written on the value
of double data entry. While conventional wisdom used to insist upon
double data entry, it may be of questionable value, especially if the
data entry system provides edits as data are entered. Double data entry
is still recommended for cases in which data entry staff enters data
"heads down" or with no edits flagged as the data are entered.
