## 3.22 Quality Control Procedures

Data integrity and study credibility depend on factors such as ensuring
adherence to the protocol, obtaining complete followup information on
all participants enrolled, and using quality control measures to
establish and maintain high standards for data quality. A quality
control plan should be developed before the study starts and adhered to
through completion. It may include standard operating procedures (SOPs),
data and forms checks, onsite monitoring, numerous reports, and problem
correction procedures. This section should detail the various aspects of
the plan and describe any training and certification procedures.
