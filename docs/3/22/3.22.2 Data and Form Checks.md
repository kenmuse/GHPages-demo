### 3.22.2 Data and Form Checks

Data and form checks depend upon the complexity of the study. Data
quality control checks may identify potential data anomalies such as:

-   Missing data or forms

-   Out-of-range or erroneous data

-   Inconsistent and illogical over-time dates

-   Fields on a \"completed form\" actually not completed; or no reason
    for missing data is provided.

If the study is using electronic data forms, provide a summary of data
and form checks that will be implemented for data quality control.
