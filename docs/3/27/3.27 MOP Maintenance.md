## 3.27 MOP Maintenance

The MOP is maintained and updated throughout a study. This section
describes the procedures for updating and distributing updated MOP
versions as well as staff members responsible for this activity. The MOP
should be available to site staff in looseleaf form. Each page of the
MOP should be numbered and dated, and contain a version number to
facilitate any changes and/or additions. The MOP may serve as a history
of the project, documenting the time and nature of any changes in
procedures and policies.

The MOP should be continuously reviewed by the Coordinating Center to
ensure that the operating procedures described are accurate. If any
procedures have been changed or modified, the MOP should be
updated---and the appropriately modified pages distributed, with
instructions, for replacement in the MOP. A MOP template for changes is
included in [Appendix D](#_APPENDIX_D_-).
