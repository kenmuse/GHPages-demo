### 3.22.1 Standard Operating Procedures

One aspect of site quality control is a set of SOPs. They describe a
site's generic procedures that may have been developed to assist with
standardization across studies. SOPs may include laboratory and pharmacy
procedures, and storage of study documents. As relevant, SOPs should be
developed by a site to ensure quality studies and study staff should be
trained on them. The SOPs should be located in a central location and
made easily available to staff for reference.

SOPs that relate to conduct of clinical trials should be listed in this
section of the MOP. Note: printed SOPs should not be inserted in the
MOP, as printed versions of SOPs should be limited in order to maintain
version control. The location of each SOP (i.e., electronic file name)
can be included in this section.
