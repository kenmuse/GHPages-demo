### 3.10.1 HIPAA Authorization

The HIPAA authorization form may be a separate document from the
informed consent, and must be reviewed and signed by the study
participant in addition to reviewing and signing the consent form. The
format of the HIPAA authorization is established by the local IRB.
Investigators should review information provided in Impact of the HIPAA
Privacy Rule on NIH Processes Involving the Review, Funding, and
Progress Monitoring of Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Research
Contracts
(<http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-025.html>)
and contact their appropriate institutional officials to learn how the
Privacy Rule applies to them, their organization, and their specific
research project. Another helpful resource is Protecting Personal Health
Information in Research: Understanding the HIPAA Privacy Rule, NIH
Publication 03-5388 at
[http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov](http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/).

If the study is collecting any personal identifiable health information,
this should be explained in this section of the MOP. Additionally, the
IRB-approved HIPAA form should be included in the appendix.
