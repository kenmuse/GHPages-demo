## 3.9 Screening and Eligibility Criteria

To help assure that study sites accrue participants with the required
characteristics, this section provides a detailed discussion of the
screening procedures utilized to determine participant eligibility. If
individuals must be enrolled in the study within a specific window of
time following completion of screening procedures, then such
requirements should be included in the MOP.

Frequently, there is a prescreening phase during which the study
coordinator responds to initial telephone calls from interested
individuals or physicians. With consideration for the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, as interpreted
by the site's institution, the PI/study coordinator may access their
clinic's medical records, hospital admission, or discharge notes, if
necessary, to identify potential candidates for screening.

which leads to \'Assign Participant to treatment\', which leads to
\'Conduct Follow-up Visits\', which leads to \'Complete Final
Assessment\', which leads to
