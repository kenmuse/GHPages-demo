### 3.13.2 Scope/Schema

In this section of the MOP, each visit should be explained in enough
detail so that a new or substitute team member can perform the visit.
Step-by-step instructions should be provided for all study procedures.
This may include defining the purpose of the assessment, the time of
data collection, or the processes for handling unscheduled visits.
