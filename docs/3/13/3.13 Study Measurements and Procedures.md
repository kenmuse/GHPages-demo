## 3.13 Study Measurements and Procedures

To ensure that assessments and measures are conducted consistently
across study participants and sites, this section describes procedures
for performing assessments and outcome measures. For example, in a
weight loss study, the procedure for capturing weight and blood pressure
might be described as follows:

-   Weigh participant between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. while fasting and
    without shoes.

-   Measure blood pressure while participant is in a sitting position.

All outcome and safety evaluations (e.g., blood chemistries) should be
delineated in this section.
