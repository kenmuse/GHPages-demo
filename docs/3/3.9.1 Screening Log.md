### 3.9.1 Screening Log

A Screening Log provides documentation of all individuals that are
reviewed for study eligibility. Usually, it contains an identification
number (ID) and individuals' initials, age, gender, race and ethnicity,
screening date, and eligibility status:

-   Eligible for study participation and date enrolled

-   Ineligible for study participation and reason

-   Source of participant (i.e., advertising, referral, etc.)

It may also contain the randomization number. The MOP describes the
contents of the Screening Log and maintenance procedures, including
frequency of updates and processes for secure storage. A sample
Screening Log is included in [Appendix
A](#appendix-a.-sample-screen-log).

Note: This information is usually part of the reporting requirements for
data and safety monitoring.
