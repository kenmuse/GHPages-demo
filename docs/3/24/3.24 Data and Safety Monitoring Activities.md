## 3.24 Data and Safety Monitoring Activities

The roles and responsibilities of the entities monitoring participant
safety and study quality are described in this section. All clinical
trials supported by NCCIH must have a data and safety monitoring plan.
The type of safety monitoring is determined by the size and/or nature of
the study and is specified in the Notice of Grant Award. Small,
single-site studies usually have an Independent Monitoring Committee,
while large multicenter studies require an independent (of the study,
investigators, and participating institutions) DSMB that is advisory to
the NCCIH Director. However, if a small, single site study is determined
to pose a significant risk to participants, a DSMB may be required by
NCCIH.

Safety monitoring activities by the DSMB or independent monitor(s)
include: reviewing the protocol with emphasis on data integrity and
participant safety issues, monitoring AEs, protecting the
confidentiality of the data, and making recommendations to NCCIH and the
PI regarding the study and its progress. This section of the MOP should
present a data and safety monitoring plan and name the members of the
monitoring body.

To assist in preparing a monitoring plan, generic monitoring plans for
studies requiring a DSMB or independent monitor(s) are available on the
NCCIH Web site. The generic plans describe the monitoring procedures
required by NCCIH.
