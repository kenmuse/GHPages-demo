## 3.12 Blinding and Unblinding (Masking and Unmasking)

In most studies with randomization, participants and the treating
physician are \"blinded\" or \"masked\" to the treatment and do not know
if the participant is receiving the study intervention or placebo. The
study statistician and/or a designated study staff member securely
maintains the randomization codes so that the treatment assignments are
not revealed. Randomization and blinding/unblinding procedures are
typically determined prior to the enrollment of the first participant.

Unblinding is a serious action and should be limited to reduce potential
bias. In the event that unblinding occurs, the following should be
recorded:

-   ID of the unblinded participant

-   Reason for unblinding

-   Study staff person responsible for unblinding

-   List of person(s) who have been unblinded

The investigators' procedures for unblinding should be clearly specified
in the MOP.
