### 3.21.1 External Data

External data refers to data sent to or collected at a study
organizational component other than a clinical site (e.g., central
laboratory, imaging facility, etc.) This section of the MOP should
describe how this information will be collected, labeled, handled,
shipped, tracked and reconciled, so that study data are not lost. As
stated in the HIPAA guidelines, personal identifiers such as name,
geographic location, social security number, and 15 other specific
individual identifiers should not be used. Therefore, it is important to
specify how participant materials will be coded (e.g., by participant
identification number) during transmission.
