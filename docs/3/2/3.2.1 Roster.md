### 3.2.1 Roster

The roster includes the names, roles, addresses, phone numbers, fax
numbers, pager numbers and e-mail addresses of study staff members,
NCCIH staff, and DSMB or safety officer.

A notation of whom to contact regarding special situations and
study-related questions should also be included. Examples of questions
include:

-   Protocol requirements

-   Reporting an adverse event (AE)

-   Request for additional supplies

-   Randomizing a participant

-   Unblinding a participant (should not be done lightly).
