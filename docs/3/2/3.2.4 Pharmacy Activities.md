### 3.2.4 Pharmacy Activities

"Pharmacy" refers to the unit responsible for the storage and
dispensation of an investigational drug agent. An actual pharmacy may be
directly involved in a study, or the investigational agent may be
delivered directly to the study site in prelabeled, sealed packages.

This section of the MOP describes how the investigational agent is to be
prepared, dispensed, stored, and returned to the Coordinating Center,
the Sponsor, or other designated organization. It provides instructions
for completing drug accountability records and administrative records.
