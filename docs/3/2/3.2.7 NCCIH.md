### 3.2.7 NCCIH

Many interventional multicenter studies sponsored by NCCIH are funded
under a cooperative agreement (U01), an \"assistance\" mechanism, in
which substantial NCCIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is
anticipated during the study. Consistent with this concept, the dominant
role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project
as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among
the awardees and NCCIH. NCCIH supports and stimulates the awardees'
activities in a partnership role. However, NCCIH does not assume
direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the study's
activities. NCCIH's role and responsibilities in the conduct of the
trial should be delineated in this section.
