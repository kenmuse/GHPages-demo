## 3.20 Retention of Study Documentation

The length of time all study files are to be maintained is specified in
this section. NIH policy requires that studies conducted under a grant
retain participant forms for 3 years, while studies conducted under
contract must retain participant forms for 7 years. Individual IRBs,
institutions, states, and countries may have different requirements for
record retention. Investigators should adhere to the most rigorous
requirements and should retain forms and all other study documents for
the longest applicable period.
