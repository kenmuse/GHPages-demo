### 3.2.6 Other Study Committees

In large studies, there may be an Executive Committee that is
responsible for reviewing study progress and identifying and resolving
issues. The NCCIH program director/project officer may be a member of
this committee. The Executive Committee is the small study leadership
group that guides the study implementation and operations. Studies often
include a number of other committees (e.g., Recruitment and Retention,
Safety, Quality Control, Publications, etc.)

All relevant study committees should be briefly described.
