### 3.26.2 Publications

Investigators have a responsibility to the public to make study results
available as soon as possible. The MOP should detail the publication
policy so that data are not released inappropriately, authorship is
predetermined, and manuscripts are subjected to rigorous review before
they are submitted for publication.

The Coordinating Center or PI must check with NCCIH if there are plans
to publish data before the study is over.

Effective September 27, 2008, responsible parties are required to report
basic results of clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov within 12 months
of trial completion, or within 30 days of FDA approval of a new drug or
device.
