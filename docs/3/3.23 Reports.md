## 3.23 Reports

Once a study begins, routine reports prepared by the Coordinating Center
or study statistician are an important quality control tool. Monthly
reports may describe target and actual enrollment by site and in
aggregate, individuals screened with reasons for screen failure, and
participant disposition (enrolled; active, completed, and discontinued
treatment; and lost to followup). Monthly reports can also list or
summarize AEs and SAEs. Administrative reports can list the forms
completed, entered, and missing and/or erroneous data and forms.
DSMB/independent monitor(s) and NCCIH will specify the type and
frequency of reports they wish to receive. Other reporting requirements
(e.g., to local IRBs and other regulatory bodies) should also be
described.

In this section of the MOP, please discuss the types and frequency of
the reports that will be prepared, and the members of the study team who
are responsible for their completion.
