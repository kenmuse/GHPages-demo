## 3.5 Study Intervention

A study intervention can be defined as administration of a test article
to prevent or change the natural course of a disease or condition.
Interventions include drugs, nutritional supplements, surgery, devices,
behavioral activities (e.g., coping mechanisms, cognitive training),
and/or lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise). A clinical trial has an
intervention that is assessed for efficacy and/or safety.

This section should include a detailed description of the type of
intervention and how it will be implemented.

Intervention must be thoroughly described so that all participants have
the same exposure:

-   For **Pharmaceutical studies**, including nutritional and hormonal
    interventions, the distribution, preparation and handling, labeling,
    and administration are detailed along with the duration of treatment
    and criteria for treatment discontinuation. A detailed description
    of the information that must be provided is documented in the ICH E6
    Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. This document is available on the
    Internet: [*http://www.ich.org\
    /fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6_R1/Step4/E6_R1\_\_Guideline.pdf*](http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6_R1/Step4/E6_R1__Guideline.pdf)

-   **Device studies** require a detailed description of the device and
    its intended use. Information on device studies is provided in the
    Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Parts 800 - 1299,
    revised as of April 1, 2000 (see
    [*http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/\
    21cfrv8_00.html*](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/21cfrv8_00.html)).

-   **Biobehavioral** and **life style** **studies** describe how the
    intervention is to be carried out as well as documentation of the
    process.

-   **Surgical studies** require a detailed description of the
    procedure.
