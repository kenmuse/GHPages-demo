## 3.4 Communications Plan

Ongoing communications among study site investigators and members of the
committees are essential to assure study progress and address emerging
study issues. The Coordinating Center should document these
communications. This section describes the study communications plan.

Regular communication with the NCCIH Program Officer should also be
described in this section.
