## 3.7 Participant Retention

Participant retention requires careful planning and continuous efforts
and helps to ensure a successful study. Every effort should be made to
retain study participants without coercion. During enrollment, it is
important to obtain the names and contact information for several
individuals closely related to the participant (e.g., next of kin,
friends, etc.). Such individuals can be contacted in the event that a
participant does not return for followup visits.

Plans and suggestions for participant retention should be described and
may include strategies such as:

-   Monthly phone calls

-   Birthday and holiday cards

-   Reminder postcards.

An action plan for correcting retention problems should also be provided
in this section.
