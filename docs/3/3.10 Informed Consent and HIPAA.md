## 3.10 Informed Consent and HIPAA

This section of the MOP describes the specific instructions for
obtaining informed consent. If there are multiple consent documents
(e.g., collecting data from additional sources, participation in
ancillary studies), then each informed consent form should be outlined
in the MOP and accompanied by detailed instructions. A template of the
Informed Consent(s) should be included in the MOP.

The necessary signatures based on the site\'s IRB requirements (e.g.,
the participant/legal representative, the investigator or person
actually obtaining the consent, and a witness) should be delineated.

This section should indicate who receives a copy of the informed consent
form and where the original will be held.

[NCCIH Informed Consent
guidelines](http://nccih.nih.gov/grants/toolbox/consent) and [NCCIH
Informed Consent Checklist](http://nccih.nih.gov/grants/toolbox/consent)
should be accessed for additional details.
